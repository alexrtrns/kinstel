                    <h2>1. Service Agreements</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kinstel Solutions operates on a project-based model where services (web design,
                        development, etc.) are detailed in a formal agreement. This agreement includes a
                        clear scope of work and a payment schedule.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Cancellation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clients may request to cancel a project at any time by providing written notice to
                        contact@kinstel.com.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a project is canceled before any work has commenced, any advance payment may be
                        eligible for a partial or full refund, determined on a case-by-case basis.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. No Refunds After Work Commencement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once work has commenced on a project (including but not limited to design mockups,
                        coding, or content creation), any fees paid are non-refundable. Our fees cover the
                        time, resources, and expertise dedicated to your project from its inception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We do not offer refunds for services that have already been rendered or are in progress.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Project Abandonment</h2>
                    <p>
                        If we do not receive communication from the client for a period of 30 consecutive
                        days, the project will be considered abandoned, and any payments made will be forfeited.
                    </p>
